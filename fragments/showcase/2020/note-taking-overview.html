    My Note Taking Explorations
</h1>

<p>The beginning of my note taking explorations.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The tools I developed to compile and publish my school notes such as,
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/subscript-publishing/subscript-html" target="_blank">The HTML Toolchain</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Also the notes themselves:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://colbyn.github.io/school-notes-spring-2020/" target="_blank">colbyn's math notes</a>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Which I used to great effect and yet such left much to be desired, especially for hand drawn
                        notes (see the
                        following chem notes).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                My proof-of-concept chemistry notes:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a
                            href="https://colbyn.github.io/old-school-chem-notes/dev/chemistry-1010---fall-2021/index.html" target="_blank">root
                            index</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Where this differs from other note taking apps is its ability to support giant autogenerated
                        <strong>tables
                            of contents</strong> from the root notebook down to the individual pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a
                            href="https://colbyn.github.io/old-school-chem-notes/dev/chemistry-1010---fall-2021/overview.html" target="_blank">example
                            page</a>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Overall I wanted notes that were as compact as possible for any viewport resolution, and that could be navigated
        as
        quickly as possible in an obvious way.

            The code for all my note taking explorations culminated into the mono repo over at
            <a href="https://github.com/subscript-publishing/subscript" target="_blank">subscript-publishing/subscript</a>
        </strong>
