<h1 class="title">Milestone</h1>
<p><strong>At the end of 2019 I raked up an impressive 1,323 contributions on GitHub</strong> that placed me among the platform’s most active developers.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective, data from a 2016–2017 GitHub ranking shows the 256th most active user recorded 1,322 contributions—my activity surpassed this benchmark, placing me among the platform’s top contributors. While my work wasn’t featured in such lists due to follower-based filtering, my focus remains on creating impactful projects.</p>
